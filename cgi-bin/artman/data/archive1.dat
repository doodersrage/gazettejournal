1¡1073967396¡1¡1073967396¡1¡1¡12¡2004¡New Main Street Direction Outlined¡Mathews residents heard details of a proposal to revamp Main Street and the roads surrounding the court green at a meeting Tuesday.¡<p align=justify>Mathews County residents and Main Street merchants were presented with some specific ideas for revamping Main Street and the roads surrounding the Court Green during a meeting Tuesday night. Approximately 100 people attended the public meeting at Kingston Parish House, which followed a "stakeholders" meeting of Main Street merchants that drew around 60 people. This was the second of three stakeholders meetings that will be held, and the first of two public meetings. The final presentations to both merchants and the public will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 3, at the same location.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Representatives from LandMark Design Group and Mathews Main Street again discussed a seven-stage plan for narrowing Main Street, realigning roads and curbs, upgrading sidewalks, relocating overhead utility wires, dealing with storm water, and generally creating a more attractive "streetscape" with lighting, signs, greenery, and furniture. But this time they came with preliminary drawings and projected costs.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Clayton E. Massey, P.E., of LandMark said that the cost of the long-term project, if completed in its entirety, would be approximately $6.4 million, most of which would be paid for with grant funds. A large portion of the matching funds needed to pay the remaining amount, said Mathews Main Street chair Marilyn Overstreet, could be covered with in-kind projects.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>A break-down of cost percentages showed that, while the streetscape would be the most expensive part of the project, at 30 percent, putting all overhead utilities underground would take the next biggest chunk of funds, at 21 percent. Water and sanitation needs would take 19 percent of the budget, while survey and design would be about 10 percent. The planners said they allowed 13 percent for contingencies and seven percent for escalation in costs, since the project is expected to take a number of years to complete.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>The group explained that the road upgrades could be done in seven phases, with only a portion of Main Street being worked on during each phase. Beginning with a "gateway zone" near the ABC store, the work would proceed in five phases from Hyco Corner, through "transition" and "North downtown" zones to a "core zone" around the intersection of Main and Church Streets and Maple Avenue. It would then continue through "South downtown" to a "rural transition" zone that would end at a point just beyond Kingston Parish House. The roads around the court green would be included in the project as a seventh phase because of their proximity to Main Street.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>The primary change to the roadway, explained engineer Margaret Kubilins of Kubilins Transportation Group, would be to narrow its width, from varying wider widths, to create 12-foot lanes from Hyco Corner to just past the Kingston Parish property, except for the core zone around the intersection of Main, Church, and Maple, where the lanes would be 14 feet wide to make sure large service trucks, fire engines, and school buses would have plenty of turning room. </p>¿0a<p align=justify>This change in road width would result in better visibility for pedestrians crossing the road and for motorists pulling out onto Main Street from Church Street and Maple Avenue, increasing safety in the downtown area, said the planners. And it would create unpaved space in front of stores that could then be used for improving or installing sidewalks, planting greenery, and creating seating areas for pedestrians.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>But the road changes would result in a net loss of parking spaces in the downtown, from the current 423 spaces to 404 spaces. They would also require doing away with the pull-in parking in front of Hudgins Pharmacy, Dollar General Store, and Mary’s Beauty Shop, and with parallel parking along the stretch of road where Christie Chevrolet is located. The planners explained that VDOT, which would be making the grant funds available, does not allow parking that requires backing out into the right-of-way, and that doing away with the parking at Christie Chevrolet would allow pedestrians access while leaving the dealership show space for its cars.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>While audience members objected to a reduction of spaces in a downtown that already has a parking shortage, Massey explained that moving the courthouse, the sheriff’s office, and all the administrative offices from the Court Green to the new courthouse might free up spaces in the downtown area. Kubilins pointed out that, at a minimum, seven spaces now reserved for the sheriff’s office would be available for public use.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Massey said that the planners realize that parking is the single biggest issue in terms of businesses being able to function and so they want to maintain as much on-street parking as possible. But part of the plan would also include better access to off-street parking in public lots and behind buildings.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Also in the interest of having businesses continue to function, landscape architect Vaughn B. Rinner said the plan was to have only one side of the road worked at a time, which would allow businesses to remain open. She said business owners would need to communicate with their customers about the impact the project would have and how long it would last.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>During discussion, Beverly Holmberg of North pointed out an "aborted attempt" at bringing community water to the downtown area a few years ago, and said that before anyone "begins tearing up streets," there needs to be a consensus of opinion about planning for community water. Massey agreed and said that the only way to proceed with the project without such a consensus would be to install "dry lines" for future use.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"Without an agreement on water and sewer, we would be limited," he said.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Donna Owens took exception to the article about the project in last week’s Gazette-Journal, saying that it referred to Mary Diggs’s business, Mary’s Beauty Shoppe, as a mobile home. "It’s not," she said. "We don’t want to stretch this so far that it will impact this generation."</p>¿0a<p align=justify>(Diggs’ daughter, Nancy Dicus, said in a telephone conversation with this reporter that the proper term for the building is "modular home.")</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Other issues that were discussed were making Brickbat Road more accessible to take some traffic off the Main and Church intersection, providing parking for the handicapped, solving problems with accessibility to Food Lion and the post office, and accommodating special functions such as Market Days in the design.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Several audience members voiced support of the plan. Constance Ober, owner of Halcyon, Inc., which is located at the intersection of Main and Church Streets, said she liked the proposed design of the roads around the intersection. She said she and her husband, Carlton Brooks, had seen many near-accidents in the area, and they both agreed that the design would create a safer intersection.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Michael Warren, who described himself as a Cobbs Creek resident for 20 years, called the plan "admirable" and said he felt that renovation had been "a long time coming in this county."</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"We owe it to the people coming up behind us to make improvements," he said. "If we don’t, we’re never gonna have much here."</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Before the meeting closed, Overstreet reminded everyone that the type of project being considered is long-term and will take a long time to plan and even longer to fund. She said, "It’s not something that’s going to be completed by next Market Days or even Market Days in five years."</p><!--W2WBODYEND-->¡auto¡¡5¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡11¡14¡pm¡1¡¡1¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2¡Sherry Hamilton¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2004011211114¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡

"These animals add to families," said Jean Duggan, Executive Director of the Gloucester-Mathews Humane Society.¡<p align=justify>As we celebrate the beginnings of a new year, many animals, both young and old eagerly await a loving, permanent home. "These animals add to families," said Jean Duggan, Executive Director of the Gloucester-Mathews Humane Society. </p>¿0a<p align=justify>Duggan said, "Often we associate the shelter with just animals, but it involves people as well." According to Duggan, the Gloucester-Mathews Humane Society currently staffs about 15 workers, with most of them being part-time. Duggan said much of the help, however comes from volunteers, who head up all of the outreach programs that the society offers. </p>¿0a<p align=justify>Such outreach programs, according to shelter manager Beth Hogge, involve going with a few of the animals to places such as Wal-Mart and the local area nursing homes. Duggan said another exciting thing that is run completely by volunteers is known as the "Puppy Program."</p>¿0a<p align=justify>This involves the transport of over 100 dogs to approved locations out of state. "The purpose of this program is to save lives here and discourage puppy mills up north," said Duggan. Puppy mills are places where the overbreeding of dogs takes place, and this process is discouraged, according to Duggan.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>As for adoptions in 2003, Duggan said that it had been a good year, with statistics showing over 800 adoptions. However, she also said that the number of animals turned in has not dropped from last year’s total of approximately 3,700.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"This doesn’t mean the rest of them are euthanized," said Duggan. Some, she said, are re-claimed by owners, while others become part of the "Puppy Program." Duggan said that the facility also works with many rescue groups, as well as with the Heritage Humane Society in Williamsburg, where many of these animals are sent.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>To Duggan’s surprise, Hurricane Isabel did not put a damper on adoptions. "After the hurricane, we just knew adoptions would slow down. But, it made us feel really good that people still came in looking for the animals." Duggan felt that this was because the pets help in the healing processes of such traumatic situations.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>In efforts to promote more accessible hours to the public, Duggan announced that the Humane Society has changed shelter hours, effective January 4. The operation is now open from 1 to 4 p.m. on Sundays, will be closed Wednesdays and will operate from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"This is something many of us have been dreaming about for a long time," said Duggan. "I see this step as a positive one for the community." It is her hope that the public will take advantage of these new hours.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>As for pets available for adoption, Duggan said a wide variety of animals are currently at the Humane Society. Along with the cats and dogs, Duggan said that they have two pot-belly pigs, three guinea hens, plenty of rabbits and even one emu. </p>¿0a<p align=justify>Duggan said that the Humane Society could comfortably hold about 100 animals. "However, we never turn anyone away. We try to always find space," said Duggan. When possible, Duggan said that they double up the animals in cages if necessary.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>According to Duggan, 253 animals were taken into the facility in November, with the majority of those being surrendered, or turned in by previous owners or from being found out on the loose. In October, Duggan said that 397 animals were taken in. In August, though, there was a peak of 441 take-ins, according to Duggan.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"I’ve been here three years," said Duggan. "Others who have been here longer say that in the past, the numbers of drop-offs have tapered off this time of year, but now it’s not as sharp a drop-off as previously." </p>¿0a<p align=justify>"The bottom line," according to Duggan, "is that we still promote spay/neuter." Duggan said that she can’t stress this enough. She mentioned that if people feel that they don’t have the funding for getting this done, that they can contact Animal Care Of Mathews. A long time partner of the Humane Society, Animal Care can be reached at 725-5242.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Duggan said that sometimes she and her staff become discouraged about the number of animals that are taken in. "But, we’re here. People know we’re here and know we can take care of them," said Duggan.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>"All you have to do is look at these faces. They deserve a second chance," said Duggan. "They don’t understand why they are given up. We learn so much from these animals, and they give such unconditional love."</p>¡auto¡¡5¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡11¡17¡pm¡1¡¡1¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2¡Quinton Sheppard¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2004011211117¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡

Think creatively, with a little help.¡<p align=justify>The holidays are over. The children, grandchildren and families have all returned to their respective homes. The leftovers from Christmas dinner and New Year’s celebration have all been consumed, frozen or disposed of. Now it’s back to cooking for just one or two. It’s time to re-think dinner. It’s time to think small.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Would you believe that 60 percent of America’s households today consist of just one or two people? So if this applies to you, keep in mind you are in the majority.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>But cooking for one or two doesn’t have to mean boring or difficult. Some of the world’s top culinary experts have recently written cookbooks filled with delicious recipes serving one of two. Most of these recipes call for versatile staples, like potatoes in new ways. And most are very creative when it comes to having to buy the ingredients. They avoid waste.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Small batch cooking tips:</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Shop where they sell in bulk bins, but buy small portions. Many stores feature spices, teas, grains and even nut butters in bulk. Buy little, as you need.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Buy produce items available in small units. The produce department is packed with nutritious foods like potatoes, an excellent source of vitamin C and potassium that can be purchased one at a time. You can even mix different potato varieties and colors and still buy only a few. This also applies to fruit and other vegetables.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Shop at the salad bar. If your recipe calls for small amounts of carrots, celery, broccoli or greens, find them at the supermarket’s salad bar.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Don’t waste the stock. Pour unused stock into ice cube trays. Freeze, unmold, and store cubes in freezer bags for future soups or casseroles.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Use today’s meal to make a new dish tomorrow. Cook extra potatoes to use later in the week. Leftover mashed potatoes can make potato pancakes or be used to thicken a soup. Toss roasted potatoes with pasta, use in an omelet, or sauté with artichokes and herbs.</p>¿0a<p align=justify>Treat yourself to some fresh home-cooking. You’ll be in good company.</p><!--W2WBODYEND-->¡auto¡¡1¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡11¡19¡pm¡1¡¡1¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2¡Betty Wrenn Day¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡2004011211119¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
